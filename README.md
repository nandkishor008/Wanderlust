# 🌍 Wanderlust

Wanderlust is a full-stack web application I built that works like a simplified version of Airbnb. Users can create listings for places they want to rent out, and others can browse or search for vacation homes based on their interests and location.

## 🔧 Features

- Users can browse all listings with images and pricing
- Search destinations with live suggestions as you type
- Add, edit, and delete your own listings
- Login / Signup system using sessions (Passport.js)
- Upload images (multiple preview support) using Cloudinary
- Fully responsive design — mobile, tablet, and desktop friendly
- Logout option and session management
- Location-based search (optional Google Maps integration)

## 💻 Tech Stack

### Frontend:
- HTML5 + CSS3 (Bootstrap for layout & responsiveness)
- JavaScript (vanilla DOM manipulation)
- EJS templating engine for rendering views

### Backend:
- Node.js with Express.js
